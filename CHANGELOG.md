## [Unreleased]

## [1.7.0] - 2026-07-03

### Added
- **`ax-watch`** — login-free, background receive detection. Polls KakaoTalk's chat list via the macOS Accessibility API and fires hooks/webhooks when a chat's unread count increases. No server contact (no ban risk), never steals focus, never opens a chat (unread state stays untouched). A background-friendly replacement for the LOCO-based `watch`, which needs a server session that recent KakaoTalk builds break.
  - Filters: `--hook-chat <exact display name>`, `--hook-keyword <text matched against the chat's message preview>`.
  - `--json` emits one NDJSON event per detected increase; console output otherwise.
  - Gated by `--allow-watch-side-effects` (same flag as `watch`) when a hook/webhook is configured.
  - Only polls visible/loaded chat rows — a new message bumps its chat to the top of the list, so incoming activity is caught without scrolling.
  - `WatchMessageEvent` gained an additive `unread` field and `WatchHookConfig` an additive `chat_names` filter; both are backward-compatible and don't change existing `watch` behavior.

### Fixed
- `local-send`/`ax-read`/`ax-watch` now give a clear, actionable error when KakaoTalk's main chat-list window can't be found because it's **minimized** or **on a different macOS Space (virtual desktop)** than the one currently active — both cases previously surfaced as a generic "is it open?" message. The Accessibility API only sees windows on the active Space, and a minimized window's `AXMinimized` state was found (via live testing) to sometimes bring KakaoTalk to the foreground if auto-restored — since this tool never steals focus, it now asks you to un-minimize by hand instead. One-time fix if this keeps happening: right-click the KakaoTalk Dock icon → Options → Assign To → All Desktops.

## [1.6.0] - 2026-07-02

### Changed
- **`local-send`/`ax-read` are dramatically faster — a real KakaoTalk chat open/read went from 12–24s down to ~2s (measured), roughly a 6–11x speedup.** The macOS Accessibility tree was previously walked from scratch on every lookup; it is now walked once per operation into an in-memory `AxNode` snapshot, and each node's role/children/value/help/description are fetched in a single `AXUIElementCopyMultipleAttributeValues` batch IPC call instead of 2–5 separate cross-process round-trips. No behavior change: chat matching, ambiguity refusal, `[사진]`/`[파일]` placeholders, and the Accessibility-permission check are all identical to v1.5.1.
- Set `OPENKAKAO_CLI_DEBUG=1` to see per-step timing breakdowns for `local-send`/`ax-read` on stderr, for diagnosing future performance regressions.

## [1.5.1] - 2026-07-02

### Fixed
- v1.5.0's release CI failed: `ChatMatch`/`match_chat_row` (the pure, cross-platform chat-matching function added in v1.5.0) are only called by the macOS-only `imp::open_chat_row`, so on non-macOS builds — where `mod imp` doesn't compile and `mod stub` never needs to match a chat row — they were unused outside tests and flagged as `dead_code` under `-D warnings`. Marked `#[cfg_attr(not(target_os = "macos"), allow(dead_code))]`, the same pattern already used for `stub::AxMessage`.

## [1.5.0] - 2026-07-02

### Changed
- `local-send`/`ax-read`'s chat-matching logic (exact-match, ambiguity refusal) is now a pure, unit-tested function (`match_chat_row` in `src/ax_send.rs`), verified on every platform release CI runs on rather than only informally on a macOS dev machine.

### Added
- `ax-read` no longer silently drops photo/file messages from its output — rows with no text but a detected image or file-share now appear as `"[사진]"`/`"[파일]"` placeholders instead of leaving a gap in the conversation order.
- `local-send`/`ax-read` now detect a missing Accessibility permission grant up front and fail with a clear "enable it in System Settings → Privacy & Security → Accessibility" message, instead of a confusing "chat not found" error.

## [1.4.4] - 2026-07-02

### Fixed
- v1.4.3's macOS-only dependency gating fixed the Linux `verify` job's build step, but its Rust-target-agnostic clippy pass then flagged the non-macOS stub's `find_kakaotalk_pid` as dead code (it existed but was never called). Removed the unused stub function and marked `stub::AxMessage`'s fields `#[allow(dead_code)]`, since that type exists purely to keep the stub's public API shape matching the real macOS implementation and is never actually constructed on non-macOS builds.

## [1.4.3] - 2026-07-02

### Fixed
- **Release CI was building the whole crate on a Linux runner** (`verify` job on `ubuntu-latest`), which fails to even compile the new AX dependencies (`accessibility`, `core-graphics`) since they link Apple-only frameworks (`error[E0455]: link kind 'framework' is only supported on Apple targets`). v1.4.0–v1.4.2 all failed to publish because of this. `accessibility`/`accessibility-sys`/`core-foundation`/`core-graphics` are now `[target.'cfg(target_os = "macos")'.dependencies]`, and `src/ax_send.rs` provides a `cfg(not(target_os = "macos"))` stub with the same public API (returns a clear "only supported on macOS" error) so the crate builds cleanly cross-platform again.

## [1.4.2] - 2026-07-02

### Fixed
- `cargo fmt` compliance for the v1.4.0/v1.4.1 AX-send additions — the release CI's `cargo fmt --check` gate failed on both tags, so neither published binaries. No functional change.

## [1.4.1] - 2026-07-02

### Fixed
- Removed a real personal display name accidentally left in a v1.4.0 code comment and docs example (`src/ax_send.rs`, `website/content/docs/cli/local-send.mdx`), replaced with generic placeholder names. Source-only — never compiled into the binary — but should not have been committed.

## [1.4.0] - 2026-07-02

### Un-deprecated
- **Project maintenance resumes.** LOCO/REST server login (`login --save`, `login --manual`) is still broken on recent KakaoTalk macOS builds and remains unfixed (#15, #20, #22) — but `local-send` and the new `ax-read` now give a fully login-free path for both sending and reading, so the CLI is useful again without a working server session. README/website deprecation notices updated accordingly.

### Changed
- **`local-send` rewritten to be entirely AX-based, dropping its local-DB dependency.** The command signature changed from `local-send <chat_id> <message>` to `local-send <chat_name> <message>` — `chat_id` was a local-SQLCipher-DB concept, and that DB's key-derivation formula no longer matches current KakaoTalk builds (confirmed independently; not a porting bug, Kakao's client-side crypto has drifted). `local-send` now looks up the chat by display name directly in KakaoTalk's Accessibility (AX) tree and verifies delivery by scraping the opened chat window's own message list — no server contact and no local database read anywhere in the path.
- Chat-name matching in `local-send`/`ax-read` is now **exact-match only** (previously substring), and refuses to guess when more than one visible chat shares the same display name — there is no chat-id to disambiguate with anymore.

### Added
- **`ax-read <chat_name>`**: read the most recently visible messages in a chat via the same AX scraping used by `local-send`'s delivery verification — no server contact, no local DB access. Only messages already rendered in the open chat window are returned; scroll up in KakaoTalk first for older history.
- **`safety.allowed_send_chats`**: an exact-match allowlist in `config.toml` that `local-send` now requires for real (non-dry-run) sends. AX-send has no chat-id-based cross-check, so this is the only guard against a typo or name collision sending to the wrong chat.

### Fixed
- `local-send`/`ax-read` no longer pick up the wrong `AXTable` when a chat window is already open alongside the main chat list — row/table lookups are now scoped to KakaoTalk's main window (`AXIdentifier == "Main Window"`) specifically.
- `local-send`/`ax-read` now switch the main window to the chat-list ("chatrooms") tab before searching it, so a chat list search issued while the Friends tab happens to be active no longer fails to find the target row.
- Fixed `AXSelectedRows` being set on the row element instead of the table element (`kAXErrorAttributeUnsupported`) when selecting a chat row.

## [1.3.3] - 2026-06-29

### Deprecated
- **openkakao-cli is now deprecated and no longer actively maintained.** Recent KakaoTalk macOS builds broke the login paths and they cannot be repaired without ongoing reverse-engineering, which there is no bandwidth for. Every invocation now prints a deprecation notice to stderr (suppress with `OPENKAKAO_CLI_NO_DEPRECATION=1`). The read-only `local-*` commands still work. README marked accordingly.

### Changed
- **Reverted the v1.3.2 passcode/device-registration flow** (#20, #22): the `request_passcode.json` / `register_device.json` endpoints it relied on do not exist on current KakaoTalk macOS builds (they return 404), so the flow could never complete. `login --manual` now stops on `status=-100` with a clear explanation **and a safety warning not to retry** — repeated logins from an unregistered device have gotten real users' accounts' sub-device login blocked.

## [1.3.2] - 2026-06-27

### Added
- **`login --manual` now completes KakaoTalk's new-device verification** (#20): when logging in from a Mac the account has never seen, `login.json` returns `status=-100` (device not registered). The CLI now runs the passcode handshake automatically — it asks KakaoTalk to send a passcode (`request_passcode.json`), prompts for the code delivered to your phone / another logged-in device, registers the device (`register_device.json`), and retries the login. First-time logins from a fresh device can now finish without manually approving in the app.

### Changed
- The `login --manual` failure hint no longer claims new-device verification is unsupported; remaining non-`-999` failures point at the email/phone, password, or passcode.

## [1.3.1] - 2026-06-24

### Fixed
- **`login --manual` no longer fails with `status=-999` ("최신버전으로 업데이트가 필요합니다")** (#18): the from-scratch login path hardcoded the protocol version `3.7.0`, which recent KakaoTalk REST servers reject as too old. It now sends the version of the locally installed KakaoTalk.app (`CFBundleShortVersionString`, e.g. `26.5.0`), falling back to a recent default when the app is absent. `--app-version` still overrides. A `-999` failure now prints a targeted "update KakaoTalk / pass `--app-version`" hint instead of the generic 2FA message.

## [1.3.0] - 2026-06-09

### Added
- **`login --manual`**: log in with your KakaoTalk email/phone and password instead of scraping `Cache.db`. This path does not touch the cache — it derives the device UUID from `IOPlatformUUID`, computes the X-VC header locally, and gets a fresh token from `login.json`. It is the recommended path on recent KakaoTalk macOS builds that no longer cache the bearer token (#15). The password prompt is hidden; `--email`/`--password`/`--app-version` allow non-interactive use.
- The "zero Authorization rows" message from `login --save` now points users straight at `login --manual --save`.

### Notes
- Logging in from a device KakaoTalk has not seen before may trigger a passcode / 2FA challenge that openkakao-cli does not yet complete — approve the Mac in the KakaoTalk app first. Login is a normal auth call, not an unofficial protocol write.

## [1.2.3] - 2026-06-08

### Fixed
- **KakaoTalk 26.x local DB compatibility** (#16, thanks @mickb0t-cell): `ioreg` platform-UUID parsing no longer skips the matching line; local database discovery now matches the actual DB file instead of a hex-named directory or `-wal`/`-shm` sidecar.
- Added userId recovery paths for newer KakaoTalk builds that no longer write `FSChatWindowTransparency` or explicit userId keys: an exact `FSChatWindowFrame_` suffix lookup and a bounded SHA-512 pre-image search over `DESIGNATEDFRIENDSREVISION:` keys.

### Security
- The SHA-512 userId search is bounded by a 15-second wall-clock deadline so a missing or foreign hash cannot hang the CLI (the routine runs per-plist and up to 3× in `doctor`).
- The exact `FSChatWindowFrame_` lookup runs before the brute-force fallback; frame suffixes must be identical to be trusted (a shared trailing run no longer collapses into a wrong, smaller userId); only integer revision values are trusted when selecting the active account hash.

## [1.2.2] - 2026-05-18

### Changed
- `login --save` now distinguishes "Cache.db has entries but none carry an `Authorization` header" from "parsing failed on otherwise valid rows". The first case prints a dedicated message that points at the known KakaoTalk macOS compatibility issue (#15) and the manual-entry workaround instead of telling the user to "open KakaoTalk and click a chat" — which does not help on those builds.

### Docs
- Troubleshooting guide gains a "KakaoTalk macOS compatibility for `login --save`" section explaining why recent KakaoTalk builds break the cache-based extraction, plus a "Manual credential entry" section with the `credentials.json` schema for users who already have a token through other means.

### Known limitation
- On recent KakaoTalk macOS builds, authenticated REST responses are no longer written to `NSURLCache`, so the `Cache.db` extraction path used by `login --save` cannot recover credentials. Tracked in [#15](https://github.com/JungHoonGhae/openkakao-cli/issues/15). A long-term fix (alternate extraction path, or manual-entry-first flow) is being scoped.

## [1.2.1] - 2026-05-11

### Changed
- `openkakao-cli login --save` now prints a diagnostic when no credentials can be extracted: it shows the exact `Cache.db` path it inspected, distinguishes "file missing" / "file unreadable (Full Disk Access needed)" / "file present but no Kakao auth requests yet", and points to the action that resolves each case (#15).
- Debug logging environment variable is now `OPENKAKAO_CLI_DEBUG=1`. The legacy `OPENKAKAO_RS_DEBUG=1` is still honored as a fallback so existing scripts continue to work.

### Docs
- Troubleshooting guide now walks through the three common causes of the credential-extraction failure (KakaoTalk hasn't issued a REST call yet, `Cache.db` missing, terminal lacks Full Disk Access).

## [1.2.0] - 2026-04-17

### Changed
- **BREAKING: Renamed the project from `openkakao-rs` to `openkakao-cli`** across the GitHub repo, the Cargo package, the installed binary, and the Homebrew formula. The Rust crate now lives at the repo root (no longer under `openkakao-rs/`); workflows are `openkakao-cli-{ci,release}.yml`; the library crate is `openkakao_cli`. Old URLs (`github.com/JungHoonGhae/openkakao`) continue to redirect for now but should not be relied on long-term.
- The Homebrew tap itself (`JungHoonGhae/homebrew-openkakao`) is unchanged; only the formula name moves.

### Migration
- Reinstall with `brew install JungHoonGhae/openkakao/openkakao-cli` (the old `openkakao-rs` formula is being removed).
- Rename any scripts, launchd plists, or shell aliases that invoke `openkakao-rs` to `openkakao-cli`.
- Configuration paths (`~/.config/openkakao/…`) are unchanged — no config migration needed.

## [1.1.1] - 2026-04-17

### Fixed
- Republished the v1.1.0 binaries under v1.1.1 after the `v1.1.0` tag was force-moved and a stale `Cargo.lock` caused the rebuild to fail, leaving the GitHub Release with no assets and breaking `brew install openkakao-cli` (#14)
- `clippy::unnecessary_sort_by` violations in `analytics.rs` surfaced by clippy 1.95

### Changed
- Pinned the Rust toolchain to 1.95.0 via `rust-toolchain.toml` at the repo root so stable-channel upgrades cannot silently break the build
- Switched CI from `dtolnay/rust-toolchain@stable` to `actions-rust-lang/setup-rust-toolchain@v1` so it honors `rust-toolchain.toml`
- Release workflow now runs a `verify` job (`cargo fmt --check`, `cargo clippy -- -D warnings`, `cargo test`) before the build jobs — a red tree can no longer produce a tagged release

## [1.1.0] - 2026-03-30

### Added
- **Local DB reading (SQLCipher)**: `local-chats`, `local-read`, `local-search`, `local-schema` commands read the encrypted KakaoTalk database directly — zero server contact, zero ban risk
- **`--dry-run` flag**: preview send, delete, edit, react actions without executing (supports `--json`)
- **`send --me`**: send to memo chat (나와의 채팅) without specifying chat_id — useful for testing
- **`safety.allow_loco_write` config**: LOCO write operations (send, delete, edit, react) are now disabled by default to protect accounts from bans; opt-in via `~/.config/openkakao/config.toml`
- **Doctor: local DB checks**: `doctor` now verifies SQLCipher database access (UUID, userId, file, decryption) and LOCO write status
- **AGENTS.md**: AI agent integration guide with safe/risky command classification

### Changed
- `rusqlite` switched from `bundled` to `bundled-sqlcipher` for SQLCipher support
- LOCO write commands now require explicit `safety.allow_loco_write = true` in config (breaking change for existing automation — add the config field to restore previous behavior)

## [1.0.0] - 2026-03-11

- user-targeted local graph lookups (`profile --local`, `profile-hints --local-graph --user-id`) now prefer chat IDs inferred from cached profile hints before scanning the full LOCO graph

### Fixed
- `GETMEM`-backed local graph and profile lookups now retry through LOCO reconnects on transient `early eof` / socket reset failures
